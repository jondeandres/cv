\NewEntry{2012--Present}{Software Engineer, \textsc{Wuaki.tv}
  --- Barcelona}

\Description{\MarginText{Wuaki.tv}Wuaki.tv offers a video on demand service with movies and tv shows. I work in the backend area as Ruby developer and i'm the tech lead of one of the development teams. Wuaki.tv service is actually in Spain, United Kingdom and France. We'll launch the service in other markets soon.}
\Description{\MarginText{}In the backend area we work with Ruby on
  Rails and Sinatra as web frameworks. Most of the applications are
  written using Rails but we developed an independient user service
  using Sinatra.}
\Description{\MarginText{}I was one of the members of the team that developed the project to
  launch Wuaki.tv in UK, and the mentioned user service was one of the
  most important pieces in this project. A very critical task in the
  project was the integration with play.com (Play.com). Play.com users
  are now able to sign-in in Wuaki.tv UK with their Play.com
  credentials and all their data is synced}
\Description{\MarginText{}I've developed our own payment gateway so our applications
  have a unique gateway interface, not depending on the country or final payment gateway to use. This service
  is developed as a HTTP API that just queues AMQP messages. Some workers subscribe to the payments queue and
  the payments are processed. I've used RabbitMQ as AMQP broker and we are using some of the cool features it has. We store all the payments data in Riak.}
\Description{\MarginText{}In Wuaki.tv we're trying to go to a Continous Delivery strategy, I've been the lead of an internal project to manage the process of releasing and deployment of Github pull requests in our Amazon instances. This project use heavily the Github hooks, Jenkins hooks and some internal tools to release our projects. This is quiet similar to the service that DigitalOcean offers.}
\Description{\MarginText{}Although is not my main area, sometimes I try to help our operations department and help them organizing the Puppet modules or writing my own modules. I'm really interested in the devops tasks in our projects. So trying to help the operations area is always a good change to learn new things.

\NewEntry{2011--2012}{Software Engineer, \textsc{Gnuine}  --- Barcelona}

\Description{\MarginText{Gnuine}Gnuine it's a company in Barcelona that develops
    project for third party companies. Gnuine
    develops its own web framework, Ubiquo, on top of Ruby on Rails and most of
    the developments are done with this framework.}
\Description{
    In these projects usually we developed the backend with ruby and
    most part of the javascript development in the frontend. At the
    end of my time in Gnuine I was lead project developer and projects manager.
    The most important projects I worked for are:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item FC Barcelona. I developed some parts of the Ajax widgets for
      this projects, like photo or video galleries. Also I made some
      changes in the company framework, Ubiquo, to fit the project
      requeriments. \href{http://fcbarcelona.com}{http://fcbarcelona.com}
    \item xiptv. This was a video on demand project for regional
      televisions. Basically we developed a Rails application that
      offers the different videos for each program in all the
      televisions of the autonomic group.
      The interesting part was the encoding and processing (ffmpeg) of the
      master videos we received so different platforms, web and
      mobile, could watch them. \href{http://www.xiptv.cat/}{http://www.xiptv.cat/}
    \item La Vanguardia, elecciones Municipales 2011. This project was
      enterily written with Ruby (No Rails) and Javascript, without really a
      server application. This solution was really cool having all the
      site pre-generated and cached in cloudfront. \href{http://resultados-elecciones-2011.lavanguardia.com/}{http://resultados-elecciones-2011.lavanguardia.com/}
    \item lainformacion.com. Elecciones Municipales y Auton√≥micas
      2011. This is more or less the same project that we wrote for
      La Vanguardia but with different markup and some interesting
      features like the embeding of lainformacion.com's widgets. \href{http://elecciones.lainformacion.com/}{http://elecciones.lainformacion.com/}
    \item Comradio. I was the lead developer for this project that was
      really a big project of five application, private and public ones.
      The more interesting part of the project was the encoding and
      processing of the radio stream to generate the different tracks
      for each radio program just after they finished. \href{http://www.laxarxa.com/}{http://www.laxarxa.com/}

\Description{\MarginText{Univertsity of the Basque Country} In the
  telecomunications researching group I researched about traffic
  packages capturing in multiprocessors systems using Linux. We
  analyzed the performance of traffic processing in kernel space and in

  The main objetive of this was the QoS monitoring of traffic in high
  speed networks.}
